Sam came to Summit’s attention in the best way… by referral from the trusted source of a trusted source. From the first conversation I knew we had found someone with a clear head, a good, fair business sense, and an organized, no nonsense approach. We needed a simple fish. Not complex. A companion image for our project Phishgoggles. Could she deliver what we needed, on time and on our budget? Yup. Turns out she could, and did. It’s my suspicion that given the chance, she’d most certainly be able to do that for you, too.
