                            Sam was, from the very beginning, a true professional. [S]he was always organized, communicative, and
                            on-time with her delivery. [She] delivered top-quality artwork. I loved having her work for me! I truly 
                            wish I could hire her full time."</p>

                        <p>Sam came to Summit’s attention in the best way… by referral from the trusted source of a
                            trusted source. [...] Could she deliver what we needed, on time and on our budget? Yup. 
                            Turns out she could, and did. It’s my suspicion that given the chance, she’d most certainly 
                            be able to do that for you, too.</p>

                        <p>Samantha was able to create the type of art & style that we needed for our projects and studio. Not only 
                            did she get her tasks done on time, her art barely needed a 2nd or 3rd pass; she was able to take very 
                            little directions and create exactly what was needed.  Her art was also inspiring, as some designs would

                        <p>Samantha is also a good person to be around and to work with.  She became part of the team quickly, taking 
                            direction while also giving back her thoughts on anything from art to game design.  She shares ideas, 
                            processes, and is just fun to be around.  I look forward to working with her again.</p>
