                <p>Sam was, from the very beginning, a true professional. I hired her to help
                    develop a mobile game user interface, and she was always organized, communicative, and
                    on-time with her delivery. I never had to worry that the work would be done. Sam was very good
                    about keeping me updated throughout the project, and I always felt comfortable giving her some
                    direction and allowing her to work on her own.</p>

                <p>Sam came to Summit’s attention in the best way… by referral from the trusted source of a
                    trusted source. [...] Could she deliver what we needed, on time and on our budget? Yup. 
                    Turns out she could, and did. It’s my suspicion that given the chance, she’d most certainly 
                    be able to do that for you, too.</p>

                <p>Samantha is incredibly creative artisitcally. She learned all the graphic software easily, and 
                    created high quality content. Sam was a natural fit on the team from the start. She got along 
                    great with everyone, and her comic timing is on point.</p>

                <p>Working with Sam was a pure joy. She brought a positive attitude and a strong work ethic to the
                        Sunstorm team. Sam is an extremely talented and creative individual with a diverse set of skills 
                        -- a combo that easily brought her to the forefront on many projects. Additionally, she is a strong, 
                        supportive team member on collaborative efforts. Sam would be a wonderful addition to any creative team.</p>
